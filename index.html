      <h3>Female Confession</h3>
      <p class="confession-text">"Hi admin pls hide my identity so well Im not from UC but I really love to read those people's confessions
So Im gonna say this confession to my recent bf,so I met this boy online for about like 2021 we just talked to each other chatting everyday and night i didn't notice that I was really into him and he was into me too he confessed first and not long enough we became lovers day and months goes by I realize something that why did I fall inlove in such a young age,so after that I didn't say it to him that I want to end it muna so we could focus I didn't say it because I really was inlove w/him we continued our love not until 2022 in october that I should really habe pride to say it to him that I want to end it but it was only for our own good so we could focus on our studies and I promise to him that I will comeback but not long enough I just knew that he already found someone else and the reason he said to me that "marami ka kasing excuses hndi monga ako kaya ipakilala sa pamilya mo,and sorry I seek someones attention that you couldn't give to me" maybe I didn't do all you wanted but neither he didn't know that I was struggling to balance our love and my studies I think he wanted to say that he really wants that he is only my priority,I wish I didn't meet you but thankyou for loving me for who i was and admiring my flaws"</p>

      <h3>LGBTQ+ Confession</h3>
      <p class="confession-text">"Good day admin! Again pls hide my identification co it's my main account. I am an lgbt member.
I just want to confess my spoiled story way back 2005 as I had mentioned it here before at my first confession. I use to had a colleague before in one of the leading fast food . His name is Jeffrey Garcia at that time I presume he was graduated already in his seaman career . He is a handsome guy, lean bodied with sex packs tan    skin and stands 5'8" tall.at that time idk what is his plans for me cos he invited me stay in his rented room he said together with his younger brother. I was confused coz I'm just 18 and still virgin of anything that kind of offers unlike now charizz. To cut the story I rejected his proposal and ignore him. Age siyag hagwa2x nako the moment I arrive at our working place in gaisano mactan. Refuse jud nako Siya Kay mas bet to nako Isang workmate na seaman pod SI Edge. But SI Edge kutub Rami friend zone.. you that relationship nga Sood kaayu and then walay label. Ouch ! Pero lobog ko usahay Kay Kon hagwaon ko ni Jeff.. murag Dili kaayu na mutagad SI Edge nako.. until na end mi 3 sa jobee. 10 years after nakita nkog balik SI Jeff.. nisamot ka gwapo and masculine. We've bump accidentally at Ayala Cebu. And guess what Wala na siya nitagad nko.. I assumed he was a real seaman najud that time. Medyo na awkward ko Kay ang tawo nga use to admire me.. nausab na siya enana daiy mo mga seaman Kong ma successful na maudab ang attitude. Well had to admit nakoy mistake but hey you should be down to earth whenever you reach your goal. Abi Kay dagko na kaayu alahas sa liog 😝😂✌️ . So mao to I regret at some point that I ignore him. Lesson learned grab every opportunity that knock you at once. And enjoy while your still young. 
Thank you guys."</p>
